Branch Manager is a GUI for git worktree.

Git worktree allows checking out branches into their own folders instead of checking them out in-place, making it quick and easy to switch between branches or even have multiple branches open.

With this easy-to-use app you can
- Create a worktree for or based on any local or remote branch
- Quickly open the branch's root folder in Explorer, Terminal, Visual Studio Code or open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio
